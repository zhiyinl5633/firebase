# Entry 9: MVPresentation
This will be the last entry of the independent study unit, throughout this 9 weeks, we learned as much as we could and build an MVP with what we have learned. Now, it's the time to share our learnings with our classmates through the final presentation where we will have to sum up basically everything we learned over the 9 weeks in just a few slides. *How is that even possible?!* So before making the presentation, I looked back at the presentation example that Mr. Mueller showed us, notes that I took for what makes a good presentation and previous slides that I made for last year's showcase to give me an idea of what I should include in the presentation. When working on the slides, we tried to be concise with fewer words on the sides as possible.

## Takeaways
* **Whenever you feel stuck, look back at previous notes or work to give you an idea of how to start.** Not everyone knows what they will be doing as soon as they start, so don't worry you're not the only one.
