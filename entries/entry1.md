# Entry 1: Introduction

### Choosing a Topic
As someone who has a difficulty of making decisions, choosing a topic was harder than I thought because there's just too many options. During the first week of independent study, we were given a list of possible topics that we can choose form and dive into for the next 9 weeks. When I first saw the list, I immediately clicked on the first topic and went down the list until I find one that interests me. This process was pretty much googling, googling, and googling on repeat mode. There was so much to choose from, yet so little time. Among the topics that I found interest in, I narrowed it down to SASS and Firebase. *Hmmm... Which one of these will keep me interested for 9 weeks?* Firebase. *Why?* It's because there's just so much for me to explore with Firebase.

### What is Firebase?
Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform that provides users with tools to develop high quality apps. Also, Firebase has functionalities such as analytics, databases, messaging and crash reporting. From my research and googling, I discovered that Firebase consists of multiple features, such as a chat feature that allows users to chat with each other while they are on the app. My understanding of Firebase so far is that Firebase is the back end and similar to the **Model**(or brain) of the app, which takes in the user's data and add its features to it, such as storing the data in a database.

### Next Steps
* Tinker and explore Firebase features
* Start thinking what kind of app to build throughout the 9 weeks

## Takeaways
1. **Use Codecademy.** Whenever I learn something new, I always look up for codecademy lessons to help me understand it more.
2. **Google is your friend.** If you're confused or have any questions, don't be afraid to google it. Google has the answer to almost everything.
